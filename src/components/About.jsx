                As a highly motivated senior at Boston University, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering with a minor in Economics, I have developed a strong foundation in technical expertise and business acumen. I am eager to explore opportunities that allow me to apply my skills and drive innovation and growth.

Throughout my academic journey, I have focused on refining my skills in object-oriented programming and web development, particularly using React. I have gained hands-on experience through various projects, which have deepened my understanding of these technologies. I strive for excellence in my work and constantly seek out opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.

As I approach the next phase of my career, I am excited to connect with professionals who share my passion for technology and business. I am open to exploring potential opportunities and seeking guidance from experienced individuals in the field. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to learn from your experiences and gain insights into the industry.

                I love learning new technologies and then applying them to various fields. I recently worked on an ETA prediction model for a delivery app in South Africa which gave me deeper insights about machine learning and the various models used these days. I strongly beleive in the expansion of tech to all most all fields in the coming years and that has led me to explore and read about the various upcoming technologies including blockchain and the concept of WEB 3.0. Apart from being fascinated about tech, I spend my time swing trading in the Indian stock market, working as a tutor at the engineering college and watching football.
